# Contributing

Augmented Carpentry is currently a prototype that requires multiple contributions and fixes before to be used by a large pool of users. This is why we set up an infrastructure to allow users to make contributions, suggestions, or simply fork the repo and create your own version of Augmented Carpentry.

Augmented Carpentry is an actively growing and constantly evolving project mainly maintained by [Andrea Settimi](https://github.com/9and3) at the [Laboratory for Timber Construction (IBOIS, EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ibois/) in Lausanne, Switzerland. [^1]

  The following open-source project guidelines and structures are based one the ones by the [Material project](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material).



## How you can contribute

We understand that reporting bugs, raising change requests, as well as engaging in discussions can be time-consuming, which is why we've carefully optimized our issue templates and defined guidelines to improve the overall interaction within the project. The [issue tracker] is for now our main interface to report bugs and exchange over possible implementations.

Our goal is to ensure that our documentation, as well as issue tracker and discussion board, are __well-structured__, __easy to navigate__, and __searchable__, so you can find what you need quickly and efficiently. Thus, when you follow our guidelines, we can help you much faster.

In this section, we guide your through AC processes.
