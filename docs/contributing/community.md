# Contributing

Augmented Carpentry is currently a prototype that requires multiple contributions and fixes before to be used by a large pool of users. This is why we set up an infrastructure to allow users to make contributions, suggestions, or simply fork the repo and create your own version of Augmented Carpentry.

Augmented Carpentry is an actively growing and constantly evolving project mainly maintained by [Andrea Settimi](https://github.com/9and3) at the [Laboratory for Timber Construction (IBOIS, EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ibois/) in Lausanne, Switzerland. [^1]

  The following open-source project guidelines and structures are based one the ones by the [Material project](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material).



## How you can contribute

We understand that reporting bugs, raising change requests, as well as engaging in discussions can be time-consuming, which is why we've carefully optimized our issue templates and defined guidelines to improve the overall interaction within the project. The [issue tracker] is for now our main interface to report bugs and exchange over possible implementations.

Our goal is to ensure that our documentation, as well as issue tracker and discussion board, are __well-structured__, __easy to navigate__, and __searchable__, so you can find what you need quickly and efficiently. Thus, when you follow our guidelines, we can help you much faster.

In this section, we guide your through AC processes.

### Code of Conduct

Our [Code of Conduct] outlines the expectation for all community members to
treat one another with respect, employing inclusive and welcoming language. Our
commitment is to foster a positive and supportive environment, free of
inappropriate, offensive, or harmful behavior.

We take any violations seriously and will take appropriate action in response to
uphold these values.[^2]

Please also note that AC is provided "as-is" as a prototype, without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. The user assumes full responsibility for the use of the software, and we are not liable for any damages, losses, or misuse arising from its use or its modifications.

    __Warning and blocking policy:__
    Given the increasing popularity of our project and our commitment to a
    healthy community, we've defined clear guidelines on how we proceed with
    violations:

    2.1. __First warning:__ If a user repeatedly violates community standards, they receive a formal, permanent first warning.

    2.2. __Second warning and opportunity for resolution:__ Continued misconduct leads to a second warning. The user is then granted five days to publicly respond and clarify or apologize for their actions.

    2.3. __Blocking:__ If there is no improvement after the second warning, the user may be blocked to safeguard the community’s positive environment. Blocking is rarely necessary, reflecting the community’s emphasis on constructive dialogue and respect.
