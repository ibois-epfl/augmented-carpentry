## Wood working tools
AC is designed to be *machine independent*, it is only dependent on the toolheads (e.g.: drill bits, circular saw blades and chainsaw boards). You can find a list of the available toolheads [here](https://zenodo.org/records/12578820). If you want to add your own, open a Pull Request to the repo [TTool](https://github.com/ibois-epfl/TTool) and follow the [Wiki](https://github.com/ibois-epfl/TTool/wiki).
