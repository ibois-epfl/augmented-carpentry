# Tools

<!-- AC is designed to be *machine independent*, it is only dependent on the toolheads (e.g.: drill bits, circular saw blades and chainsaw boards). You can find a list of the available toolheads [here](https://zenodo.org/records/12578820). If you want to add your own, open a Pull Request to the repo [TTool](https://github.com/ibois-epfl/TTool) and follow the [Wiki](https://github.com/ibois-epfl/TTool/wiki). -->

## Toolheads

AC is designed to be *machine independent*, it is only dependent on the toolheads (e.g.: drill bits, circular saw blades and chainsaw boards). This means that you can attach any toolhead to the machine and the system will adapt to it if the toolhead is in the list of those integrated in AC.

## Tool attachement

This is the second thing which needs to be set up. The tool attachment is the way the camera and the touch display are attached to the machine. This is important for the system to know the position of the tool in the space. The tool attachment is a simple 3D printed part which is attached to the tool and has a specific shape which is recognized by the system. The tool attachment is also used to attach the camera to the tool. The camera is used to track the tool in the space.
