# Summary

test12
<!-- this is a sort of abstract. (MAX 50 words) -->
<!-- ![Test image captation.](01_fig_placeholder.png){ width=20% } -->


# Statement of need

<!--
aka "state-of-the-art". This is a context introduction and brief state-of-the-art. (MAX 125 words)
-->

# Functionalities

<!--
brief introduction to the general functioning and the following sections. (MAX 75 words)
It might include details that are no more mentioned in the following sections like:
- the hardware used (x64, monocular camera, etc.)
- ...
-->

## Layer-stack flow

<!--
this section should illustrate the layer stack system and the applicaton.h how ti workds. To be included:
    -a) a scheme (mermaid))
    -b) a description (MAX 150 words)
-->

## Geometry framework

<!--
this section should illustrate the layer stack system and the applicaton.h how it workds. To be included:
    -a) a scheme (mermaid))
    -b) a description (MAX 150 words)
-->


## Computed Feedback System

<!--
this section should illustrate the feedback system and how the layerFeeddback can get all the information from the other layers and use the geometry system at its convinience. To be included:
    -a) a scheme (mermaid))
    -b) a description (MAX 150 words)
-->

## AR rendering

<!--
this section should include:
    -a) a scheme of the layer system and general application.h structure
    -b) a brief description of its functioning (maybe with a smal snippet of code on how to instantiate a  point (MAX 150 words)
