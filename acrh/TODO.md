TODO:
- CUTS: need to be implemented
- CUTS+HOLES: joint presenting both can be parsed by holes but are not detected as mixed. Need to implement a detector of this nature to run both a hole and cut parser on the same brep.

ADVERTISE:
- for now only boxes can be exported and from a meter workspace with high precision settings (0.0001)
